# A-B-C-Testing
A/B/C Testing of Promotion Types Across Stores
This project conducts an A/B/C test to compare the effectiveness of three different promotion types across various store locations. The analysis also considers factors such as the age of each store and the market size to understand how these variables influence promotion performance.

Key Features:

Comparison of three promotion strategies (A, B, and C)
Analysis segmented by store location
Incorporation of store age as a factor
Consideration of market size differences
Statistical evaluation to identify the most effective promotion type under different conditions

This project aims to help optimize promotional efforts by tailoring strategies to store-specific and market characteristics.
